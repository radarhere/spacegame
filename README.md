HTML5 canvas space game

What is it?
-----------

A friend of mine asked if I could help them out by making a space-based web game for their children's holiday club. While there are many such games out there on the web, they wanted one that didn't involve lasers or explosions in any way.

The end result was this HTML5 canvas game in which the pilot ship has to avoid being hit by asteroids and collect stars throughout five levels. All resources were either generated by myself or collected under licenses that meant that they were free to be used for non-commercial purposes and required no acknowledgement.

I named the ship Ezekiel, after the fact that Ezekiel 1 has been interpreted by some as a UFO sighting.

Can I see a demo?
